# Responsible Data Science Final Project

Background
The purpose of this ADS is to develop a predictive model that accurately classifies risk in life insurance applicants using a more automated approach. The goal is to make the life insurance application process quicker and less labor-intensive for new and existing customers to get a quote while maintaining privacy boundaries. Our project will be focusing on Prudential's dataset that contains over a hundred variables describing attributes of life insurance applicants, including normalized variables related to the product applied for, employment history, insurance history, family history, medical history, age, BMI, weight, and height etc. The target variable will be the “Response” column, which is an ordinal measure of risk with 8 levels. The ultimate objective is to help Prudential better understand the predictive power of the data points in the existing assessment, enabling the company to significantly streamline the process.
